# ## Motivation for this project
# 
# **There have been a recent rise in the antivaxers in most countries but especially in the developed world, this has led to a drastic reduction in the vaccination rate in these countries.
# This therefore puts these countries at risk of outbreaks from vaccine preventable disease, one such is measles. The measles vaccine was one of the earliest vaccine to have been developed. Though it is relatively safe, there are alot of antivaxers who are against its used.**
# 
# **I find this dataset personal, as I believe that in the 21st century nobody should die of a vaccine preventable disease.**

# # Measles
# 
# This data contains the overall and measles, mumps, and rubella immunization rates for schools across the United States. Each row corresponds to one school and includes a number of variables including the latitude, longitude, name, and vaccination rates.

# Print the results
print("F-value:", f_value)

# **There is a statistically significant association between state and overall vaccination rate of a school,as shown by the above analysis of variance**

# # Insights from the analysis
# 1. Public owned are the commonest type of schools in the dataset
# 2. Chicago has the highest number of schools 
# 3. The county with highest number schools is the Los Angeles
# 4. The California state has the highest number of schools in all the states
# 5. North Carolina state  has the highest number of students exempted from vaccination for religious reasons 
# 6. California state  has the highest number of students exempted from vaccination for genuine medical reasons
# 7. Wisconsin states is more likely to exempt students from vaccination for personal reasons, this is concerning because there could be countless reasons for which a student can be exempted from vaccination
# 8. Kindergarten schools have the highest overall and MMR vaccination compared to other school types, this is not surprising as most Kindergarten children are within the vaccination age for most vaccines
# 9. Schools in the Colorado state have the highest overall and mmr vaccinations compared to the other state, in California; there seems to be strong positive correlation between the overall vaccination rate and the mmr vaccination rate.
# 10. The state in which a school is located affects the overall vaccination rate of the school
# 
# 

# # Call to action
# The public health unit in Wiscosin should streghten the vaccination protocols in schools, as they are noted to have a very high of number students exempted from vaccination for personal reason
# Despite the California state having the highest number of schools, they did not necessarily record the highest number of overall vaccination, vaccinations campigns should be intensified in this state,as more schools means more students and therefore high chance of outbreak in the event of an outbreak, more students should be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.
